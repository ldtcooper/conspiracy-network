        <h2>Part One: Tom</h2>
        <p>
            The time is May 2020.
            The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down much of public life across the world.
            The death toll in the United States alone is set to surpass 100,000.
            However, there is a bright spot in all of this: there is promising news out of Germany and the United
            Kingdom about two revolutionary vaccines against this novel disease.
            The mass production and distribution of those vaccines is still six months away though.
            In the mean time, large numbers of people are convinced that COVID is not as dangerous as it seems.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will center our story on one of these people.
            His name is Tom.
            In the midst of all of this chaos, he is stuck at home with nothing but time on his hands.
            He has been spending a lot of this time on the internet, finding articles to reinforce his notion that
            COVID-19 is less dangerous than we are being led to believe.
            This leads to him not taking precautions: gathering indoors with his friends, not wearing a mask, and
            preemptively announcing that he will not be getting vaccinated.
            When his friends and family try to bring him around, he counters with the articles he's been reading.
            And as he becomes more alienated from his friends and family, he starts to go deeper into his articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The thing is, these articles don't end with "COVID is overblown."
            No, that is just where they start.
            Those articles lead Tom to more articles.
            "COVID is overblown" leads into "The vaccine is full of microchips."
            Who is putting these microchips in the vaccine?
            The Illuminati are.
            Why?
            To usher in the New World Order.
            How can we stop that?
            We can show up at the Capitol on January 6th to Stop the Steal!

        <h2>Part Two: The Rabbit Hole</h2>
        <p>
            This story is, of course, a fiction, but it contains a grain of truth.
            There is no shortage of <a
                target="_blank"="https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/why-do-people-believe-covid-19-conspiracy-theories/">academic
                research</a>, <a
                target="_blank"="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-people-fall-for-conspiracy-theories/">news</a>,
            and <a target="_blank"="https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/">popular discourse</a> illustrating how
            people fall down this rabbit hole.
            However, not everyone takes this same path.
            Some people might start being skeptical of "Big Pharma" and find their way to Flat Earth.
            Others might have doubts about Princess Diana's death and end up thinking that the government is hiding
            evidence of alien life.
            How then might we map these relationships between common concepts in the world of conspiracy theories?
        </p>
        <p>
            One way to map this has emerged in the LOCO corpus.
            This is a 88-million-word corpus compiled by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34697754/"
                target="_blank">Miani et al.</a> and released in 2021.
            By bringing together the text of thousands of articles about hundreds of topics, it enables us to use modern
            techniques in text analysis and natural language processing to study the relationships between these topics.
