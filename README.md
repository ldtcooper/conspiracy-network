# conspiracy-network

This is a project for CS 590: Topics in Data Science by [Logan Cooper](https://github.com/ldtcooper), [Dhyay Bhatt](https://github.com/Dhyay7), [Kushagra Ghosh](https://github.com/kushagraghosh), and [Naman Parikh](https://github.com/naman10parikh).

We use the [LOCO dataset ](https://osf.io/snpcg/) compiled by Miani et al. 

## Setup
The dataset from the LOCO link above has to be downloaded, unzipped, and all the files placed in the `data` directory.

This project was set up using the conda environment manager. You can install all of the necessary dependencies by running `conda env create -n conspiracy --file ENV.yml`. If you add a dependency *please* be sure to update the `ENV.yml` file.
